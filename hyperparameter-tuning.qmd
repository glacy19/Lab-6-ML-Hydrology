Reading in the data and cleaning it:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(readr)
library(powerjoin)

# Define file paths
file_paths <- c("data/file1.csv", "data/file2.csv", "data/file3.csv")

# Read files into a list of tibbles
data_list <- map(file_paths, ~ read_delim(.x, delim = ","))

# Join all datasets iteratively
merged_data <- reduce(data_list, power_full_join)

# View the combined result
print(merged_data)
```

Data splitting:

```{r}

## intiial and testing/training split 
```

Feature Engineering:

```{r}
## proper recipe
```

Resampling and model testing:

```{r}

## building resamples with cross validation dataset (k-folds)

## build 3 candidate regression models

## test the models - workflow set, map and autoplot

## model selection with justification

```

Model tuning:

```{r}
## build model for chosen specification


## create workflow

## check the tunable values/ ranges

## define the search space


```

Tune the model:

```{r}
## tune the model - code used from class

model_params <-  tune_grid(
    wf_tune,
    resamples = folds,
    grid = my.grid,
    metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae),
    control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)
  )

autoplot(model_params)
```

Check the skill of the tuned model:

```{r}
## do this by collecting metrics/ show best/ describe in plain language
```

Finalize model and verify:

```{r}
## implenent the last fit, interpret metrics, plot predictions

```

Building a map (use conus):

```{r}

```
